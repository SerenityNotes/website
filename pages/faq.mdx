# FAQ

## Why is it not Open Source?

We are planning to make the client side source code publicly visible to everyone. It probably will be a proprietary to prevent people taking the code an publishing it as their own.

Once we managed to establish a sustainable business we plan to open source more and more parts of it.

## Where do you host the servers and why?

At the moment Heroku is used for the servers and the database.

While Heroku offers a great service long term we want to migrate to a European hosting provider to have the data and company under the same jusitication.
