## FAQ

## Why are there no passwords to authenticate?

Your devices have stored secret keys which are used to authenticate them yourself with the server using public-key cryptography.

This is one of the reasons why it's recommended to connect multiple devices. Losing your one and only key would mean that your account is lost.

## Where are the servers hosted and why do we use this services?

At the moment Heroku is used for the servers and the database. Heroku is a US company, but the database and all instances are located in Europe.

While Heroku offers a great product we are considering to migrate our services to a European hosting provider in the long run.

## Why does server location matter if the content is end-to-end encrypted?

While the content itself is encrypted meta data such as who shares documents with whom and when updates took place exist.

This can be valuable information and that's why we care to store the encrypted data in a secure location.

## Why is it not Open Source?

We are planning to make the client side source code publicly available to everyone.

Once we have managed to establish a sustainable business we plan to open source the backend code.

## Why is the protocol not Open Source?

We initially started out with the ambition to have an Open Source protocol, but noticed during the development that the protocol changed constantly. While the current version is stable, we are already implementing several optimizations in the backlog (some of them breaking changes). Therefore we don't feel comfortable to package the current state into something that still needs documentation and possibly maintenance.
